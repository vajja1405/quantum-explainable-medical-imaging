Graduate Research – University of Missouri–Kansas City  
Advisor: Prof. Luke Miller  
Duration: Aug 2025 – Dec 2025

## Overview

This research benchmarks classical and quantum machine learning architectures on medical imaging tasks.

Models evaluated:

- CNN
- QCNN
- SVM
- QSVM

## Results

- Classical CNN achieved AUROC = 0.76
- QCNN achieved 5× faster training time compared to CNN
- Evaluation metrics: AUROC, AUCPR, F1-score

## Explainability

- SHAP for feature importance
- Grad-CAM for visual interpretability
